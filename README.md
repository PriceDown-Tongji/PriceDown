## Need

Nowadays more and more people buy things online, but there are many websites to buy them or many different vendors to buy from, our objective is to find the same product at the lowest price possible to save as much money as possible.

## Task
All the tasks will be performed through a command line python script.
A user, who can be either a buyer or a seller, can make use of the website “search a product” function to search for a product through several websites. Before searching the product, the user can change the country of the websites and find help on the dedicated page. The “search a product” is the heart of our system, and it makes use of web scraping and sorting algorithms to find a particular product at the best price available. It also includes several features, that let the user to filter among which specific sites to search for the product, then search it by entering its name or a link, and finally he can change the ordered all the results by increasing or decreasing prices.
After thus user has found the product, he was looking for, he will have the possibility to leave a review based on his use of the site, where you can report some bugs or suggest improvements to the site. This part of the system will be continuously in direct contact with the website administrator, so that he can make use of the direct experiences of users to improve it and solve bugs.
